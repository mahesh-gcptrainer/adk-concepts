# Multi-Agent Cloud Infrastructure Designer (`infra-designer`)

A deterministic, multi-agent AI system built using the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** for Python. The system processes cloud infrastructure requirement specifications from PDF documents through a sequential pipeline of four specialized `LLMAgent`s:

```
[PDF In] -> [Cloud Arch] -> [Net Eng] -> [Sec Eng] -> [DevOps] -> [Production Terraform HCL]
```

### Agent Pipeline & Execution Order
1. **Cloud Architect (`cloud_arch`)**: Reads and parses architectural requirements from PDF documents (via the `read_pdf_document` tool) and outputs comprehensive GCP Architecture Requirement Specifications (`arch_spec`).
2. **Network Engineer (`net_eng`)**: Translates architecture specifications into complete Google Cloud Network Topologies (`network_spec`) including custom VPCs, non-overlapping subnets, CIDR blocks, Cloud NAT, and firewalls.
3. **Security Engineer (`sec_eng`)**: Hardens the proposed architecture and network following GCP Security Foundations (`security_spec`) including Cloud KMS CMEK encryption, least-privilege IAM service accounts, Cloud Armor WAF policies, and audit logging.
4. **DevOps Engineer (`dev_ops`)**: Synthesizes all prior specifications into complete, production-ready, modular Google Cloud Terraform manifests (`terraform_infra`).

**Root Agent**: `SequentialAgent` named `infra_designer` orchestrating the deterministic flow across all four agents.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **uv**: Python package manager (used for all dependency management in this project) - [Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) ([add packages](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/dependencies/) with `uv add <package>`)
- **agents-cli**: Agents CLI - Install with `uv tool install google-agents-cli`
- **Google Cloud SDK**: For GCP services - [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- **Terraform**: For infrastructure deployment - [Install](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)


## Quick Start

Install `agents-cli` and its skills if not already installed:

```bash
uvx google-agents-cli setup
```

Install required packages:

```bash
agents-cli install
```

Test the agent with a local web server:

```bash
agents-cli playground
```

You can also use features from the [ADK](https://adk.dev/) CLI with `uv run adk`.

| `agents-cli infra single-project` | Set up single-project infrastructure using Terraform                              |

## 🛠️ Project Management

| `agents-cli infra cicd` | One-command setup of entire CI/CD pipeline + infrastructure |
| `agents-cli scaffold upgrade` | Auto-upgrade to latest version while preserving customizations |

---

## Development

Edit your agent logic in `app/agent.py` and test with `agents-cli playground` - it auto-reloads on save.

## Deployment

```bash
gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
agents-cli deploy
```
To set up your production infrastructure, run `agents-cli infra cicd`.

## Observability

Built-in telemetry exports to Cloud Trace, BigQuery, and Cloud Logging.

## A2A Inspector

This agent supports the [A2A Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/). Use the [A2A Inspector](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-inspector) to test interoperability.
See the [A2A Inspector docs](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-inspector) for details.
